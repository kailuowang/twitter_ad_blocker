## Twitter / X.com Ad Blocker

Free tool (browser extension) that hides promoted Tweets while you browse Twitter / X.com.

No signup and it doesn't track anything you do.

## Features

### Ad Blocking
Blocks promoted Tweets, promoted Topics (What's happening), suggested Articles (You might like) and promoted Users (Who to follow) in [all languages](https://github.com/ryanckulp/twitter_ad_blocker/pull/18).

### Automatic Tab Switching
Automatically switches from the "For you" tab to the "Following" tab when you load X.com, showing you a chronological timeline instead of the algorithmic one. If X.com refreshes itself and switches back to "For you", the extension will detect this and switch to "Following" again.

You can still manually click the "For you" tab if you want to view it - the extension will respect your choice for 7 seconds before resuming automatic switching.

## Extension Options

You can customize the extension's behavior by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Options":

- **Switch to Following tab** - Enable/disable automatic switching to the "Following" tab
- **Hide "Who to follow" suggestions** - Enable/disable hiding the "Who to follow" section

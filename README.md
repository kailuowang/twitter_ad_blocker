## Twitter / X.com Ad Blocker

Free tool (browser extension) that hides promoted Tweets while you browse Twitter / X.com.

No signup and it doesn't track anything you do.

## Features

### Ad Blocking
Blocks promoted Tweets, promoted Topics (What's happening), suggested Articles (You might like) and promoted Users (Who to follow) in [all languages](https://github.com/ryanckulp/twitter_ad_blocker/pull/18).

### Automatic Tab Switching
Automatically switches from the "For you" tab to the "Following" tab when you load X.com, showing you a chronological timeline instead of the algorithmic one.

## Extension Options

You can customize the extension's behavior by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Options":

- **Switch to Following tab** - Enable/disable automatic switching to the "Following" tab
- **Hide "Who to follow" suggestions** - Enable/disable hiding the "Who to follow" section
